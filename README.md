EasyToUse Auto Recon Tool

Step 1:

If you have no idea what a enviornment file is I suggest you watch a youtube video about it.
To make this file work you must make a enviornment variable in the same folder as the script. name it '.env_var'
Paste this in it.



EMAIL_ADDRESS=your email address

EMAIL_PASSWORD=your email password



TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your twilio account sid


TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your twillio auth token

#If your confused on what to fill in these just google it.

#1. Make a gmail address, you need 2FA and app password






#2. Make a twillio account and buy a phone number(its free unless you get upgraded which means you can message anyone in the world without verification). Find the account sid and auth token is easy.

Fill in what it asks.

Step 2:

do sudo chmod 777 setup.sh
RUN IT --> ./setup.sh

And your good to go enjoy.
